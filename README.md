# Final Project: Finch Robot Challenges

## Essential Question
How can we apply object-oriented programming principles and Java concepts to create interactive, autonomous robot behaviors that solve real-world challenges?

## Project Overview
In this project, my partner and I coded a Finch 2.0 Robot to do roughly 1/3 of the cha cha slide. We chose to light up the bird's beak whenever it moved and to cut the light out when it didn't, which created a more impressive atmosphere of the robot's capabilities when it danced.

Some challenges faced were the Bluetooth connection to the robot. More than once, it spontaneously disconnected; the connecting app just didn't work; or it connected, worked, but did not follow through when the actions were called. Future enhancements, if given more time, could have been to complete the entire song as well as work on the timing.
